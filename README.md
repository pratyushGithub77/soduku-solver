Sudoku Solver

This Java project implements a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm. The solver efficiently fills in a 9x9 Sudoku grid, taking into account the rules of Sudoku. It includes a main class for testing the solver, a solver class (sudokuSolver), and utility methods for checking the validity of moves and printing the solved Sudoku grid.

Usage:

Clone the repository.
Run the sudokuSolver method in the main class to find a solution for the provided Sudoku grid.
Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to enhance the Sudoku solving algorithm!
